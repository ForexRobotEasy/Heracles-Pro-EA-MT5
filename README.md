## Strategy Description

The Heracles Pro EA is a trading robot designed for the MetaTrader 5 platform. It aims to capitalize on market movements by opening buy trades when specific conditions are met. The expert advisor uses predefined constants for lot size, stop loss, and take profit levels.

The expert advisor operates as follows:

1. Initialization: The expert advisor initializes by setting the magic number, stop loss, and take profit levels.

3. OnTrade(): This function is called when there are open positions. It modifies the stop loss and take profit levels for the open positions based on the current market conditions.

4. OnTradeTransaction(): This function is called when there is a trade transaction. It can be used to perform any necessary operations based on the trade transaction, such as sending signals or updating the GUI.
